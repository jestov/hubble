## What is HR Training and Development?

HR Training and Development refers to the continuous effort of organizations to enhance the performance and skills of their employees. It encompasses a broad range of activities designed to improve group and individual performance within the organization. Through strategic training and development programs, businesses can ensure their workforce is adaptable, skilled, and ready to meet current and future challenges. This area of HR is pivotal in fostering a culture of continuous learning and growth, ensuring employees not only meet their job requirements but also contribute to the organization's strategic goals in a meaningful way.
